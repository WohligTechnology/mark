                                    Post-war France revolutionized female beauty, abandoning a fixed fashion standard for more fluid lines and lighter silhouettes. In Paris a young hairdresser, Jacques Dessange crowned this new generation of free women by creating innovative, elegant
                                    and natural cuts. Pioneer of hairstyles full of movement which enhance the face, he established the Coiffé-Décoiffé ("messy look") technique which led to his success.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    In 1954, to give free rein to his creativity, Jacques Dessange opened his first salon on the Champs-Elysées – soon to become a famous "temple" where hairdressing and global beauty were reinvented on a daily basis. The generous ambition which has
                                    driven the brand forward since its creation is still, even now, modeled on this historic salon that has since moved to 39, avenue Franklin Roosevelt where the heart of Maison DESSANGE continues to beat.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    In the 60s, the pioneer spirit and professionalism of Maison DESSANGE made a real name for the company. It launched the "Prestige Shows", spectacular demonstrations which, every year, brought together hairdressing professionals in the Cirque d'Hiver
                                    venue in Paris. In its desire to bring about the reign of beauty, the brand expanded worldwide, while its founder created training centers around the world where the trade is handed down with passion to the future architects of glamour.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    Today, this same passion drives all the key players of Maison DESSANGE, today chairmes by Benjamin Dessange, expanded by its elegant legacy and forever turned towards the future. With 500 salons spread throughout more than 45 countries, it exerts its
                                    influence and know-how across the globe.
