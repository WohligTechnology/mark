                                        Post-war France revolutionized female beauty, abandoning a fixed fashion standard for more fluid lines and lighter silhouettes. In Paris, young hairdresser, Jacques Dessange crowned this new generation of free women by creating innovative, elegant and
                                        natural cuts. Pioneer of hairstyles full of movement which enhance the face, he established the Coiffé-Décoiffé ("messy look") technique which led to his success.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">
                                        In 1954, to give free rein to his creativity, Jacques Dessange opened his first salon on the Champs-Elysées – soon to become a famous "temple" where hairdressing and global beauty were reinvented on a daily basis. The generous ambition which has driven
                                        the brand forward since its creation is still, even now, modeled on this historic salon that has since moved to 39, avenue Franklin Roosevelt where the heart of Maison DESSANGE continues to beat.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">
                                        In the 60s, the pioneer spirit and professionalism of Maison DESSANGE made a real name for the company. It launched the "Prestige Shows", spectacular demonstrations which, every year, brought together hairdressing professionals in the Cirque d'Hiver venue
                                        in Paris. In its desire to bring about the reign of beauty, the brand expanded worldwide, while its founder created training centers around the world where the trade is handed down with passion to the future architects
                                        of glamour.</p>

                                        Today, this same passion drives all the key players of Maison DESSANGE, today chairmes by Benjamin Dessange, expanded by its elegant legacy and forever turned towards the future. With 500 salons spread throughout more than 45 countries, it exerts its
                                        influence and know-how across the globe.

                                                Light and colors emerge from a velvety black background as symbols of irresistible femininity. The graphic lines of the accessories and styling with an Eighties inspiration match the acid and translucent colors that are hot news this season. Visibly layered
                                                cuts with wispy ends brighten up faces. The misleading simplicity of texture and styling and the flowing movements of the cuts evoke a feeling of freedom and natural sophistication. Colors have their word
                                                to say with intensity and candor.
